## 🟢 General Questions

### ❓ Who can contribute to the WebDev wing?

Only **first-year students** verified through OpenCode.

❌ Seniors
❌ External contributors
→ PR will be closed without review.

---

### ❓ Can I work on multiple WebDev tasks at the same time?

No.

- Work on **one task per PR**
- Finish it, get it reviewed, then move to the next

This avoids conflicts and confusion.

---

### ❓ Do I need prior Web Development experience?

No.

You are expected to:

- Know **basic HTML/CSS**
- Be willing to read instructions carefully

Everything else is part of learning.

---

## 🌿 Branch & Repository Doubts

### ❓ Which branch should I work on?

👉 **Only the `webdev` branch**

❌ Do NOT work on:

- `main`
- any other wing branch

PRs to the wrong branch will be rejected.

---

### ❓ I forked the repo but I only see the `main` branch. What should I do?

You need to **fetch all branches**.

Example:

```bash
git fetch --all
git checkout webdev
```

If you don’t do this, your PR will be invalid.

---

### ❓ Can I create my own folders or files?

No.

- Work **only inside the task folder** mentioned in the issue
- Do not rename or restructure folders unless explicitly asked

---

## 🛠 Task & Coding Questions

### ❓ Can I use Tailwind / Bootstrap / React?

❌ No.

For WebDev tasks:

- Only **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**
- Frameworks defeat the learning purpose

---

### ❓ Can I copy code from the internet if I understand it?

No.

- You may **read documentation**
- You may **understand examples**
- But you must **write your own code**

If your code looks copied, mentors may ask you to explain it.

---

### ❓ Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT?

🚫 AI-generated code or explanations are **not allowed**.

If detected:

- PR will be closed
- You may be disqualified from future issues

Use AI only for **concept understanding**, not code generation.

---

### ❓ My solution works but looks different from others. Is that okay?

Yes 👍

There is **no single correct UI**.

What matters:

- Logic
- Clean code
- Following instructions

---

## 🧪 PR & Review Questions

### ❓ What makes a PR acceptable?

Your PR should have:

- Correct branch (`webdev`)
- Changes only inside the task folder
- Clean commit messages
- Original code
- Clear understanding

---

### ❓ What are common reasons PRs get rejected?

- ❌ Wrong branch
- ❌ AI or copied code
- ❌ Unclear or messy commits
- ❌ Ignoring task instructions
- ❌ Extra unrelated files

---

### ❓ Will mentors explain why my PR was rejected?

Usually, yes — **if effort is genuine**.

Low-effort or rule-breaking PRs may be closed without discussion.

---

### ❓ Can I update my PR after review comments?

Yes.

- Push new commits to the **same branch**

---
