# What you understood from this task?
___What was the goal? What was expected from you?___

The task was to create a working landing page for techtonic using basic html and css tags. Rules made it clear that the expectation was not to build something flashy but something well-structured and thoughtful with primary focus being on stucture and layout.

# How you implemented the solution?
___Why you chose certain HTML tags or CSS layout method?___

I designed the website on paper first. I decided the layout and features of the website beforehand on paper. I took reference from other websites and gave my own touch to it. So with that in mind I started incorporating features one by one. I googled and AId the tags I needed to get a particular feature working. Learnt about how they work and applied them to the best of my ability.

For the html part, I used semantic tags like nav, section, header and footer to structure the layout. Each section was treated as a full-screen section to give a page like scrolling experience.

For the css part, I used flexbox for alignment and css grid in the features section as required by the task. I also went down the rabbit hole of scroll snapping. That was uneccessary but I had gone too deep to turn back. And honestly, I spent hours just to get scroll snapping to work correctly.

# What you learned from this task?
___New concepts, mistakes you realized, improvements___

Scroll snapping!
I was already familiar with basic html and css tags. I also got practice working with flexbox more. Also divs finally clicked to me. You use divs when you want to give a certain property to multiple different elements of a section. Also debugging css behaviour logically rather than trying random things. I kept making improvements to the layout. Placing stuff in different areas trying to see which one looks best.

One important thing I learnt is that css and html feels boring initially but it becomes more enjoyable as you go on.

# What you think is good about your solution?
___Structure, readability, responsiveness, etc.___

Everything is good about my solution :) (I hope). It's well structured. It's responsive. It's pleasing to the eye because of the heavy padding and large texts. It's minimalist and modern looking. Not too flashy. Simple and clean.

# What could be improved or what felt difficult
___Even small things — honesty matters___

Scroll snapping is still a bit finicky. There's a lot of wasted space, especially in the first section. A logo or picture could be added beside the text block - "This is TechTonic".

Working with layout, padding and alignment felt difficult. I struggled for a long time to get the footer to work properly with scroll snapping. I did not test this on a touch screen. I do not know if scroll snapping would work properly on touch screen.

# Any other thoughts that came to your mind while working
___Confusion, clarity moments, questions, ideas___

One important thing I learnt is that css and html feels boring initially but it becomes more enjoyable as you go on. Most of my thoughts have been conveyed in my other anwers.
