# 🌐 TechTonic 2.0 — Web Development Wing

**First-Year Training Repository | OpenCode**

> Learn Web Development the **right way** — through structured tasks, clean workflows, and mentor-verified contributions.

## 🎯 Purpose of WebDev Wing

This wing is designed to help **first-year students**:

- Understand how real frontend projects are structured
- Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals (no frameworks first)
- Practice Git + GitHub workflows in a safe environment
- Prepare for advanced OpenCode Web repositories

This is **not a tutorial repo**.
This is **training through contribution**.

---

## 👥 Who Can Contribute?

- ✅ **First-year students only**
- ✅ Verified OpenCode contributors
- ❌ Seniors / external contributors are not allowed

Any violation → PR closed without review.

## 🌿 Branch Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

| Branch   | Purpose                   |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| `webdev` | All Web Development tasks |
| `main`   | ❌ No project code        |

⚠️ **Rules**

- All work must happen **only in `webdev`**
- PRs to `main` will be **rejected**
- Copying only the `main` branch = ❌ invalid contribution
